\chapter{Toward Application: Walking}\label{chap:walking}
As the control strategy of Chapter \ref{chap:mpc} is in \ac{2D}, in this chapter a new strategy is proposed that is implementable on a real robot. First a experimental setup is shown with preliminary observations, to support assumptions made in the method developped. In the end, results are shown in simulation and on hardware.
% Experimental Setup
\section{Experimental Setup}
Evalutation of the strategy will be done based on push recovery on flat terrain. The situations considered when the push is applied are to be distinguished in two cathegories:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A static case, where the robot is standing
	\item A dynamic case, where the robot is walking
\end{itemize}
In both cathegories, limited foothold options are provided, such that step location adjustment would not be possible. Also, step timing is assumed to be given beforehand and is fixed, to make comparison with other control strategies more straight forward. The control strategies compared with are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item ``Ankle'' strategies: the desired \ac{CMP} is constrained to be inside the support polygon. 
	\item ``Ankle'' and ``Hip'' strategies : the desired \ac{CMP} can leave the support polygon uptil a maximum allowed distance.
\end{itemize}
The stepping parameters used for the walking test situation are given in Table \ref{tab:stepping}.

%Preliminary observations
\subsection{Preliminary Observations}
Before developping of a control method, the behavior of the system is studied, to get more insight in its behavior under handling errors. The following properties are observed after applying pushes on the robot from different directions in the experimental setups considered:
\begin{itemize}
	\item After a push in the swing phase, the direction of the \ac{ICP} error stays approximately the same until transition to \ac{DS}.
	\item If the \ac{ICP} error is directed in the sagittal plane, the desired \ac{CMP} often remains somewhat in the same location.
	\item if the \ac{ICP} error is directed  in the coronal plane, the desired \ac{CMP} slides from back to the forth of the foot.
	\item The configuration and velocity near transition to \ac{DS} affects the robots ability to put its swing leg down at the desired time. Also, the swing leg can collapse at touch down if the negative height velocity is too high.
	\item When the $\dotldz$ is high near the end of \ac{DS}, the robot can have problems with the transition to \ac{SS}.
\end{itemize}

%Strategy 
\subsection{Control Variables}\label{sec:strategy}

%
\paragraph{Alignment} of the line between $\rcopd$ and $\cxy$ with the vector $\icpe$ is used as a decision variable. If the vectors are perfectly aligned, $\ddzd$ will request $\dotldxyheight$ in the same direction as $\icpe$. This is, considering alignment, the perfect case to use height control. If the vectors are orthogonal, the requested $\dotldxyheight$ will be orthogonal to $\icpe$ and will not help driving back the error. Furthermore, the error in will grow in its orthogonal direction. Height control for any alignment in between the two cases mentioned will have a combined effect in resolving $\icpe$ in its direction, and generating additional error orthogonal to it.

\paragraph{Distance} in the horizontal plane between $\rcopd$ and $\cxy$ plays an important role in the effectiveness of height variation, \todo{secref}. As $\icpe$ and the virtual leg might not be perfectly aligned, the distance accounted for in the controller is the distance between the $\rcop$, and $\cxy$ projected on the line that is parallel to $\icpe$ and intersecting with $\rcopd$. In \figref{fig:phiViz} the alignment angle and the distance are visualized for different cases at entry of \ac{SS} for the test stepping parameters considered.

\paragraph{The $\rcopd$ dynamics}

\paragraph{Constraints} that are considered are a minimum and maximum height and height velocity. The maximum length of the leg describes a part of a circle throught the swing phase. In the controller, this constraint is captured in two constraints: $\zmaxfirst$, in the first halve of the swing phase and $\zmaxscnd$, in the second part of the swing phase. In \figref{fig:heightconstraints} the two constraints are vizualized. 
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=.3\linewidth]{STYLESTUFF/heightconstraints.png}
   \caption{Height constraints through \ac{SS}}
    \label{fig:heightconstraints}
\end{figure} 
The predicted height the current state is about to reach is computed as:
\begin{equation}
	\zmaxpred = z + \sgn(\dot{z})\frac{\dot{z}^2}{-2\ddzminpred},
\end{equation}
where $\zmaxpred$ is the predicted maximum height from the current state and $\ddzminpred$ is the predicted maximum deceleration that will occur. This would be the gravity acceleration, but the minimal acceleration is limited. 
\paraskip
The minimum height constraint is not dependent on singularity of the swing leg and is kept at a constant value. Next to hitting the ground, a low height can cause problems at transfer to \ac{DS}, when the robot gets raised to default height again. The minimum height constraint $\zmin$ is displayed in \figref{fig:heightconstraints}. In a similar way as $\zmaxpred$, the minimum height constraint is computed as:
\begin{equation}
	\zminpred = z - \sgn(\dot{z})\frac{\dot{z}^2}{2\ddzmaxpred},
\end{equation}
where $\zminpred$ is the predicted minimum height from the current state and $\ddzmaxpred$ is the predicted maximum acceleration that will occur.
\paraskip
Contraints on the maximum height velocity $\dzmax$ and minimum height velocity $\dzmin$ are also taken into account. Reasons for this include collapsing of the swing leg at touch down and limited velocities at the robot. 



\paragraph{The time to the constraints} can also be computed, as a constant acceleration is considered. Time to maximum constraint, considered the minimum and maximum acceleration:
\begin{equation}
    z + \dot{z}\tzmax + \frac{1}{2}\ddzdmax\tzmax^2 + \frac{1}{2}\frac{(\dot{z} +\ddzdmax\tzmax)^2}{-\ddzminpred}= \zmax,
\end{equation}
where $\tzmax$ can be computed in the following way:
\begin{equation}
    \underbrace{\frac{1}{2}(\ddzdmax + \frac{\ddzdmax^2}{-\ddzminpred})}_a\tzmax^2 + \underbrace{(\dot{z} + \dot{z}\frac{\ddzdmax}{-\ddzminpred})}_b\tzmax + \underbrace{z - \zmax + \frac{1}{2}\frac{\dot{z}^2}{-\ddzminpred}}_c.
\end{equation}
Noting that $a$ is positive and that the time needs to be the positive solution, the predicted time to the maximum constraint reads as:
\begin{equation}
    \tzmax=\frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 -4ac}}{2a}
\end{equation}
\paraskip
The predicted time to the minimum constraint is computed in a similar way:
\begin{equation}
    z + \dot{z}\tzmin + \frac{1}{2}\ddzdmin\tzmin^2 - \frac{1}{2}\frac{(\dot{z} +\ddzdmin\tzmin)^2}{\ddzmaxpred}= \zmin,
\end{equation}
where $\tzmin$ is computed as:
\begin{equation}
    \underbrace{\frac{1}{2}(\ddzdmin - \frac{\ddzdmin^2}{\ddzmaxpred})}_a\tzmin^2 + \underbrace{(\dot{z} - \dot{z}\frac{\ddzdmin}{\ddzmaxpred})}_b\tzmin + \underbrace{z - \zmax + \frac{1}{2}\frac{\dot{z}^2}{\ddzmaxpred}}_c.
\end{equation}
Noting that $a$ is strictly negative and that the time needs to be the positive solution, the predicted time to the minimum height constraint reads as:
\begin{equation}
    \tzmin=\frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 -4ac}}{2a}
\end{equation}
\paraskip
The time to the maximum and mimimum velocity can be computed using a linear equation:
\begin{equation}
	\tdzmax = \frac{\dzmax - \dot{z}}{\ddzdmax}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\tdzmin = \frac{\dzmin - \dot{z}}{\ddzdmin}
\end{equation}
