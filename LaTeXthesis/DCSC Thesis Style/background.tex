% Modeling of Walking
\section{Legged System Preliminaries}
In this section, commonly used expressions and background related to legged systems are briefly presented.
\subsection{Human Balancing Strategies}
As humanoid robots are a derivation of the human, human balancing strategies are briefly discussed. In \figref{fig:human}, human balancing strategies are shown. The `ankle strategy', `hip strategy' and stepping strategy are most commonly considered as a balancing strategy. However, the figure includes the `suspensory strategy' \cite{hasson1994clinical}, which is less commonly considered. With the `suspensory strategy', the human is in a slightly lower configuration with bend knees to have more control authority of the ankles.

Height variation is often not considered for a standing human. A reason for this might be that the human is often assumed to stand with straight legs. The goal of the `suspensory strategy' however, gives an interesting insight to the problem. If during the `suspensory strategy' the human would apply more force on the ground, such that a gain in height occurs, the effect of the `suspensory strategy' will get smaller as the legs straighten. Therefore, height variations for balance control can be a trade-off between the application of additional force and the gain in height.

% Ground Reference Points
\subsection{Ground Reference Points}\label{sec:grp}
In biped locomotion, the dynamics of the system are often assumed to be depending on the forces resulting from ground contact, the \ac{CoM} location and the angular moment about the \ac{CoM}. The contact forces are commonly summed up in a single \ac{GRF}, coming from a single point of application in the supporting area of the walker. Ground reference points are used to describe the dynamics of the system in a single point, using \ac{GRF} and \ac{CoM} states.

% ZMP
\paragraph{The zero moment point} is the point on the ground where the resulting \ac{GRF} does not produce any moment in the horizontal plane at the point of application \cite{sardain2004forces}. By definition, this is the point where the part of the \ac{GRF} that does not cause angular momentum around the \ac{CoM} intersects with the ground surface. The \ac{ZMP} was initially introduced in \cite{vukobratovic1969contribution}. The \ac{ZMP} is formulated as:
\begin{equation}
    \rzmp=\cxy-\frac{\fgrxy}{\fgrz}z+\frac{\taucom}{\fgrz},
\end{equation}
where $\rzmp = [x_{zmp}, y_{zmp}]^T$ is the \ac{ZMP} location, $\fgrxy=[\fgrx,\fgry]^T$ and $\fgrz$ are the horizontal and vertical components of the \ac{GRF} respectively, $\cxy = [x,y]^T$ and $z$ are the horizontal and vertical components of the \ac{CoM} Cartesian position and $\taucom = [-\tau_y,\tau_x]^T$ is the torque about the \ac{CoM} in the horizontal plane. 

In \figref{fig:zmpvscmp} the definition of the \ac{ZMP} is visualized for two different modeling choices, using both a connection between the ankle and the \ac{CoM} as a prismatic joint. In \figref{fig:3dlipfoot}, no inertia is considered around the \ac{CoM} and the \ac{GRF} $\fgr$ coming from the \ac{ZMP} intersect with the mass $m$. The difference in position between the ankle location and the \ac{ZMP} is affected by the ankle torque $\tauankle$. In \figref{fig:3dlipfootinertia}, body inertia of the system is approximated by adding a flywheel with inertia $\inert = [I_x, I_y]^T$ to the model. The \ac{GRF}, coming from the \ac{ZMP}, can be pointed away from the \ac{CoM} by using the body torque $\taucom = [\tau_x, \tau_y]^T$ as input. 

% CoP
\paragraph{The center of pressure} coincides during walking over flat ground with the \ac{ZMP} \cite{vukobratovic2004zero}. The two points however are not equal in more complex environments. The \ac{CoP} is restricted to be located in the support polygon, while the \ac{ZMP} is restricted to be located on the ground plane  \cite{sardain2004forces}. Traditionally, the \ac{CoP} is a measured quantity from a force pressure plate under the foot. In this thesis, the \ac{CoP} location is denoted as $\rcop = [x_{cop}, y_{cop}]^T$ and considered equal to $\rzmp$, as a flat contact surface is used as reference.
%The \ac{CoP} is linked to the \ac{GRF}-moment, while the \ac{ZMP} is related to the effects of external forces on the \ac{CoM} state \cite{sardain2004forces}.

\label{fig:zmpvscmp}
\end{figure}

% CMP
\paragraph{The centroidal moment pivot} includes, unlike the \ac{ZMP} and \ac{CoP}, angular momentum around the \ac{CoM}  \cite{popovic2005ground}. This is defined as the point where a line passing through the \ac{CoM}, parallel to the \ac{GRF} intersects with the ground surface. Unlike the \ac{CoP}, the \ac{CMP} is not constrained to lie inside the support polygon. The \ac{CMP} is defined as:
\begin{equation}
    \rcmp=\cxy-\frac{\fgrxy}{\fgrz}z,
    \label{eq:cmp}
\end{equation}
where $\rcmp =[x_{cmp}, y_{cmp}]^T$ is the \ac{CMP} location. In \figref{fig:3dlipfootinertia} the difference between the \ac{ZMP} and \ac{CMP} is graphically explained. Note that without body inertia in the model, the points coincide, as is depicted in \figref{fig:3dlipfoot}. Equivalently, if $\taucom=0$, the points coincide as well.

%leg modeling
\subsection{Inverted Pendulum-based Models}
The line between a ground reference point and the \ac{CoM} can be modeled as an inverted pendulum. In this thesis, this line is also called the \textit{virtual leg}.

\paragraph{The linear inverted pendulum model} is widely used in walking research and especially in legged robotics \cite{kajita20013d}. The \ac{LIP} provides fast, closed-form solutions when integrating over time. In the \ac{LIP} equations of motion, the horizontal motion of the pendulum tip does not affect the pendulum length $l$:
\begin{equation}
\ddcxy=\frac{g}{l}\cxy,
\label{eq:LIPeom}
\end{equation}
where $\ddcxy$ is the horizontal \ac{CoM} acceleration. At any horizontal position, a constant leg length is considered and the motion is at a constant height $l=z_0$. In \figref{fig:3dlip} the \ac{3D} motion is visualized if the \ac{CoM} is relatively far from from the base. The pendulum base lies in the origin. Because the \ac{LIP} assumption holds, the vertical component of $\fgr$ cancels out gravity acceleration: $\fgrz=mg$.\\
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{STYLESTUFF/3DCoMwithoutfoot.png}
\caption{\ac{3D} motion of \ac{LIP} model.}
\label{fig:3dlip}
\end{figure}

To model body inertia of the robot, sometimes a flywheel is added to the \ac{LIP} \cite{pratt2006capture}, \cite{stephens2007humanoid}, \cite{koolen2012capturability}. By controlling the torque applied on the flywheel, the \ac{CoM} dynamics can be controlled.

% height var model
\paragraph{Height varying models} consider, unlike the \ac{LIP}, height variation of the \ac{CoM}. Three examples of such models are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The, not linearized, inverted pendulum model \cite{kuo2005energetic};
	\item The \ac{SLIP} model \cite{liu2015trajectory};
	\item A pendulum with prismatic joint, not constrained to maintain a constant height: the \ac{VHIP} \cite{pratt2007derivation}.
\end{itemize}
The inverted pendulum model is often used in human motion research, as in \cite{kuo2005energetic}. The advantages of a \ac{LIP}, like fast, closed-form solutions to the dynamics, are often not needed. The \ac{SLIP} model originates from hopping and running robots \cite{schwind1998spring}. Deviations from the nominal height or pendulum length are modeled as mass-spring dynamics. 

Throughout this report, special focus is given to the \ac{VHIP}. In \figref{fig:3dvhip} the \ac{VHIP} is depicted. The dynamics of the point-mass can be written in two ways. One is as a function of the \ac{GRF} in \ac{2D}:
\begin{align}
	m\ddot{x} &= \fgrtwo\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + z^2}},\\
	m\ddot{z} &= \fgrtwo\frac{z}{\sqrt{x^2 + z^2}} - mg,
	\label{eq:dynamicsprattstyle}
\end{align}
where $\fgrtwo=[\fgrx, \fgrz]^T$ is the \ac{GRF} of the \ac{2D}  model. Works that use this style of writing are, for example, \cite{pratt2007derivation} and \cite{koolen2016balance}.

Another way of writing the dynamics of the \ac{VHIP} is as a function of the vertical acceleration $\ddot{z}$:
\begin{equation}
	\ddcxyz = \frac{g+\ddot{z}}{z}\cxyz + \vect{g},
	\label{eq:dynamicscaronstyle}
\end{equation}
where $\vect{g}=[0,0,-g]$ is the gravity force vector. The dynamical equation can be seen as a linear time-varying system. Examples of works that use the latter dynamical description for the \ac{VHIP} are \cite{hopkins2014humanoid} and \cite{caron2018balance}. Note that the two models are identical in \ac{2D}.

\end{figure}

% Energy of Walking
\subsection{Orbital Energy \& the Capture Problem}\label{sec:ewalking}
An advantage of the \ac{LIP} is that closed-form solutions to the dynamics exists. The \ac{LIP} orbital energy is an example of such a closed-form solution. This energy can be used to determine the ability of the pendulum to converge to its unstable mode: the capture problem \cite{pratt2006capture}, \cite{koolen2012capturability}.

% LIP orbital energy
\paragraph{The linear inverted pendulum orbital energy}\label{subsec:liporbit} is originally derived in \cite{kajita1992dynamic} and shows one of the main advantages of the use of a \ac{LIP} model.  This energy reads as follows
\begin{equation}
\Elip = \int (\ddot{x}-\frac{g}{l}x)\dot{x} dt = \frac{1}{2}\dot{x}^2-\frac{g}{2z_0}x^2,
\label{eq:Elip}
\end{equation}
where $E_{LIP}$ is the \ac{LIP} orbital energy. Note that the expression resembles kinetic and potential energy: one term depends on velocity, the other on position. If $E_{LIP}>0$, the point mass will cross the horizontal position of the pendulum base with its current velocity. If $E_{LIP}<0$, the point mass will not cross the pendulum base and will have a turning point where the velocity becomes zero.

% ICP
\paragraph{The linear inverted pendulum capture point} is derived more than a decade later from $\Elip$ in \cite{pratt2006capture}. Taking $E_{LIP}=0$ and taking the square root of Equation \eqref{eq:Elip} gives
\begin{equation}
\xcplip=\sqrt{ \frac{z_0}{g}}\dot{x} 
\label{eq:cp}
\end{equation}
where $\xcplip$ is the `capture point', in this thesis referred to as the \ac{CP}. This is the point where the velocity of the point-mass is exactly driven to zero and the pendulum is upright, where neither crossing of the pendulum base ocurred nor turning of body velocity. In \figref{fig:2dicp} a \ac{2D} visual explanation is given of this point. The \ac{CP} will be used for comparison with the \ac{VHIP} capture regions later in this report.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{STYLESTUFF/2DCP.png}
\caption{Visualization of the path to the \ac{CP}. }
\label{fig:2dicp}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{A capture region} will traditionally appear if the \ac{LIP} plus flywheel model is used \cite{pratt2006capture}, \cite{stephens2007humanoid}, \cite{koolen2012capturability}. As the control authority of the flywheel can change the \ac{CoM} dynamics, a set of capture points become reachable.

\paragraph{The instantaneous capture point} was introduced in \cite{koolen2012capturability}, which gives a slightly different description of the \ac{CP}:
\begin{equation}
\icp=\cxy+\sqrt{\frac{z_0}{g}}\dot{\mathbf{c}}_{xy} 
\label{eq:icp}
\end{equation}
where $\icp=[\icpx, \xi_y]^T$ is the \ac{ICP}. In this way, the \ac{CP} is written in environmental coordinates and can be seen as a point where to step in the environment to come to a stop. Other similar mentions to the \ac{ICP} are the extrapolated center of mass \cite{hof2008extrapolated} and the \ac{DCM} \cite{takenaka2009real}. 
\paraskip
For planning and control, the time derivative is often taken of the \ac{ICP}: the \ac{ICP} dynamics \cite{koolen2012capturability}. This time derivative can be written as a function of the current \ac{ICP} location and a ground reference point:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:icpdyn}
\dot{\icp}=\sqrt{ \frac{g}{z_0}}(\icp-\vect{r})
\end{equation}
where $\dot{\icp}$ is the \ac{ICP} velocity and $\vect{r}$ is a ground reference point, depending on modeling choices as discussed in Section \ref{sec:grp}.

% Boundedness
%\paragraph{The boundedness condition}\label{sec:boundedness} \cite{lanari2014boundedness} includes the effects of the motion of the ground reference point in the capture problem. The solution of $x_u$, a point that also coincides with the \ac{ICP}, reads as:
%\begin{equation}
%x_u(t,r) = e^{\omega_0(t-t_0)}x_u(t_0) -\omega_0 \int_{t_0}^t e^{\omega_0(t-\tau)}r(\tau)d \tau,
%\end{equation}
%where $r(t)$ is the trajectory described by the used ground reference point, the virtual base of the pendulum. The boundedness condition reads as follows: if the the future input $r(t)$ results in convergence of the \ac
%{CoM} to the unstable mode, the following equality holds:
%\begin{equation}
%x_u(t_0) = \omega_0 \int_{t_0}^{\infty} e^{-\omega_0(\tau-t_0)}r(\tau)d \tau.
%\end{equation}
%The initial condition, which is equal to the \ac{ICP}, has to be related to $r(t)$ by this expression.

%nonlinear orbital
\paragraph{Orbital energy with height variation}\label{subsec:nonorbit} is more difficult to derive than its linear counterpart.  Examples of attempts to include \ac{CoM} height variations in the solution to the dynamics are the time-varying \ac{DCM} \cite{hopkins2014humanoid}, the orbital energy under a virtual constraint \cite{pratt2007derivation} and the height varying boundedness condition \cite{caron2018balance}. These works are discussed in Section 
\ref{sec:relatedworksheight}, since they are highly related to the research of focus.

% Control Framework IHMC
\section{Humanoid Robotics at IHMC}\label{sec:ihmc}
To support the methods and results presented later in this thesis, this section presents a brief background on humanoid robotics at \ac{IHMC}. Most algorithms are written in Java and simulations are run in \ac{SCS}.
%robots
\subsection{Robots}
There are two humanoid robots present at the institute at the moment of writing: Boston Dynamics' Atlas \cite{koolen2016design}, \cite{kuindersma2016optimization} and NASA's Valkyrie \cite{radford2015valkyrie}. An important difference between the two robots is that Atlas is hydraulically actuated, while Valkyrie relies on electric series elastic actuators. The actuation of Atlas is in general more powerful, which allows the robot to take higher steps. Valkyrie on the other hand, has more precise torque sensing, which is important for torque control on the robot. This ties to a similarity between the robots: both robots are torque controlled. Using a control framework, the actuators of the robots can be controlled using measured and reference torque. In \figref{fig:robots}, the two robots are shown.

\end{figure}

% planning
\subsection{Planning}
In contrary to running, with walking there is a state in every cycle with two feet in contact with the ground. This is the \ac{DS} state and the state where only one leg is on the ground is the \ac{SS} state. Additionally, other states within either the \ac{DS} or \ac{SS} state are considered, like toe-off in the transition from \ac{DS} to \ac{SS}. In \ac{SS}, the leg in contact with ground is the support leg and the foot taking a step is the swing leg. The transition between those states and the duration in each state play an important role in the generation of a dynamic plan. Planning of the robots motion is conducted by separating footstep planning from dynamic planning. The dynamic plan is in this case an \ac{ICP} reference trajectory \cite{seyde2018inclusion}.
%footstepplan
\paragraph{Footstep planning} is the generation of a sequence of footsteps for the robot to follow. A Light Detection and Ranging sensor on the head of the robot provides terrain information. One way to generate a footstep plan is to let the user define each footstep via a graphical user interface. Via relatively simple algorithmic checks on for example kinematic reachability, the user interface can show whether a to be placed footstep is feasible or not. To make this process more autonomous, recently developments have been made in the creation of a footstep planner based on a A* search algorithm. 
%icpplanning
\paragraph{Instantaneous capture point planning}\label{subsec:icpplan} is the generation of a dynamic plan for the robot. It relies on the solution to the linear differential equation of the \ac{ICP} dynamics of Equation \eqref{eq:icpdyn}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:icpsol}
	\icp(t)=e^{\omega_0t}(\icp_0- \vect{r}_0) + \vect{r}_0,
\end{equation}
where $\omega_0=\sqrt{\frac{g}{z_0}}$ is the natural frequency of the \ac{LIP} and $\icp_0$ and $\vect{r}_0$ are the initial \ac{ICP} and ground reference point location or the \textit{knot-points}. This equation assumes that the location of the ground reference point is constant. 

Under the assumption of constant ground reference point locations, the ground reference knot-points, multiple methods have been developed over the years and improvements are being made. The most traditional \ac{ICP} reference trajectory is calculated with a single \ac{ZMP} knot-point \cite{englsberger2012integration} for each footstep. For each \ac{ZMP} knot-point, an \ac{ICP} knot-point is computed by integrating the \ac{ICP} dynamics backwards in time from the last footstep to the first. Using Equation \eqref{eq:icpsol}, the local \ac{ICP} reference value can be computed at any time instance within the plan. 

The above mentioned method is extended in \cite{englsberger2014trajectory}, where multiple \ac{CMP} knotpoints per foot are considered and \ac{SS} and \ac{DS} transitions are interpolated using splines. In the most recent improvements, continous \ac{CMP} reference trajectories are used for the generation of the \ac{ICP} trajectory \cite{seyde2018inclusion}. An estimate of the angular momentum generated during the walking motion is incorporated in the generation of the \ac{CMP} reference. At the time of writing, the latter method is the one currently in use, and which is used for the experiments in Chapter \ref{chap:walking}.
% icp control
\subsection{Instantaneous Capture Point Control}\label{sec:icpcontrol}
Based on a \ac{CMP} and \ac{ICP} reference trajectory, the following proportional control law is used to generate a desired \ac{CMP}:
\begin{equation}
    \rcmpd=\rcmpr + \mathbf{k}_{\xi}(\icp-\icpr),
    \label{eq:rcmpd}
\end{equation}
where $\rcmpd$ is the desired \ac{CMP}, $\rcmpr$ and $\icpr$ are the reference \ac{CMP} and \ac{ICP} from the \ac{ICP} planner respectively and $\mathbf{k}_{\xi}$ is the \ac{ICP} gain. From $\rcmpd$, the desired horizontal linear momentum rate of change is computed:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dotldxy}
    \dotldxy = \frac{\cxy-\rcmpd}{z_0}mg,
\end{equation}
where $\dotldxy$ is the desired horizontal linear momentum rate of change, which is the desired horizontal force on the \ac{CoM} of the robot. This value is send to the whole-body \ac{QP}. Note that this value is computed based on the \ac{LIP} equations of motion. 

% momentum control
\subsection{Momentum-based Whole-body Control}
The desired horizontal linear momentum rate of change $\dotldxy$, the output of \ac{ICP} control, is one of the inputs for the the whole-body \ac{QP}. The whole-body \ac{QP} finds desired joint accelerations and desired \ac{GRF}, which are translated to desired joint torques by a Newton-Euler inverse dynamics algorithm.
%centroidal
\paragraph{Centroidal dynamics} \cite{orin2013centroidal} describe the dynamics on and about the \ac{CoM} of the robot as a result of external forces like gravity and \ac{GRF}. To find the \ac{CoM} dynamics for the robotic chain of the humanoid, a short introduction is given to joint to end-effector mapping. The mapping between joint velocities and end-effector motion plays a crucial role in any robotic system:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:jacobian}
\matr{T}=\begin{bmatrix}\bs{\omega} \\ \bs{\upsilon} \end{bmatrix} = \matr{J}(\qjnt)\dqjnt \in \mathbb{R}^6,
\end{equation}
where $\dqjnt$ are the joint velocities, $\matr{J}(\qjnt)$ is the Jacobian that maps joint velocities to the end-effector twist $\matr{T}$. The twist consist of the angular velocity $\bs{\omega} \in \mathbb{R}^3$ and the linear velocity $\bs{\upsilon} \in \mathbb{R}^3$. A basis for momentum-based whole-body control is the use of centroidal momentum:
\begin{equation}
\vect{h}=\begin{bmatrix}\vect{k} \\ \vect{l} \end{bmatrix} =\matr{A}(\qjnt)\dqjnt \in \mathbb{R}^6,
\end{equation}
 where $\matr{A}=\matr{I}\matr{J}$ is the inertia matrix $\matr{I}$ times the jacobian. The centroidal momentum $\vect{h}$ consists of the angular part $\vect{k} \in \mathbb{R}^3$ and the linear part $\vect{l} \in \mathbb{R}^3$. The time derivative of the centroidal momentum, the centroidal momentum rate of change, is the constraint on the dynamics of the robot in the \ac{QP} currently in use \cite{koolen2016design}:
\begin{equation}
\dot{\vect{h}}=\begin{bmatrix}\dot{\vect{k}}\\ \dot{\vect{l}} \end{bmatrix} =\matr{A}\ddot{\vect{q}} +\dot{\matr{A}}\dot{\vect{q}} = \matr{W}_g + \sum_i\matr{W}_{gr,i} + \sum_i \matr{W}_{ext,i}, 
\end{equation}
where $\matr{W}_g$ is the gravitational wrench and $\sum_i\matr{W}_{gr,i}$ the wrench exterted by the total \ac{GRF}, as a sum from the wrench at each contact point considered. The other external wrenches $\sum_i \matr{W}_{ext,i}$ can be caused for example by other contacts than ground. These are considered zero in this thesis: $\sum_i \matr{W}_{ext,i}=\vect{0}$.
%qp
\paragraph{The whole-body quadratic program} \cite{koolen2016design} optimizes between momentum rate objectives and motion objectives to find desired joint accelerations and desired \ac{GRF}. The optimization is formulated as follows:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rlcl}
\displaystyle \min_{\bs{\ddot{q}}_d,\bs{\rho}} & \multicolumn{3}{l}{J_{\bs{\dot{h}}_d} + J_{\bs{J}} + J_{\bs{\rho}} + J_{\bs{\ddot{q}}_d} } \\%+ J_p} \\
\textrm{s.t.} & \matr{A}\ddqjntd + \dot{\matr{A}}\dqjnt = \matr{W}_g + \matr{Q}\bs{\rho}+\sum_i\matr{W}_{ext,i}\\
&\displaystyle \bs{\rho}_{min} \leq \bs{\rho}\\
&\ddot{\qjnt}_{min} \leq \ddqjntd \leq \ddot{\qjnt}_{max},
\end{array}
\end{equation}
where $\ddqjntd$ are the desired joint accelerations, $\matr{Q}\bs{\rho} = \sum_i\matr{W}_{gr,i}$ is the basis vector matrix $\matr{Q}$ times the basis vector multipliers $\bs{\rho}$. The basis vector matrix $\matr{Q}$ consists of all basis vectors of the wrench cones from each ground contact point. In \figref{fig:wrenchcone}, the wrench cone for a single ground contact point is visually explained. Currently, there are $4$ ground contact points considered for each foot of the robot.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{STYLESTUFF/wrenchcone.png}
\caption{Approximation of the wrench cone with basis vectors $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{ij}$ for ground contact point $i$. The linear part of the ground reaction wrench, $\vect{f}_i$ in the drawing, is a positive multiplication of the basis vectors and lies inside the wrench cone \cite{koolen2016design}. }
\label{fig:wrenchcone}
\end{figure}
The minimum $\bs{\rho}_{min}$ has to be at least zero, because of the unilateral contact constraint; the robot can only push with its feet on the ground. The total cost $J$ is composed of the following cost terms:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{rlcl}
$Momentum rate objective cost:$ & J_{\dot{\vect{h}}_d}= \wght_{\dot{\vect{h}}_d}||\matr{A}\ddqjntd + \dot{\matr{A}}\dqjnt - \dot{\vect{h}}_d||^2\\
$Motion objective cost:$ & J_{\matr{J}_m} = \wght_{\matr{J}_m}||\matr{J}_m\ddqjntd-\vect{p}||^2\\
$Contact force cost:$ & J_{\bs{\rho}}=\wght_{\bs{\rho}}||\bs{\rho}||^2 \\
$Joint acceleration cost:$ & J_{\ddqjntd} = \wght_{\ddqjntd}||\ddqjntd ||^2 \\
%$Privileged configuration cost:$ & J_p = \wght_p||(\matr{I} - \matr{J}_t^{\dagger}\matr{J}_t)\ddqjntd - \ddqjntp||^2,
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
where the weighting terms $\wght$ can have a selecting function as well. For example, the centroidal momentum rate of change objective $J_{\dot{\vect{h}}_d}$ only consists of the linear part and is only affected by the desired linear momentum rate of change $\dotld$. The motion task jacobian $\matr{J}_m = [\matr{J}_1^T\quad...\quad\matr{J}_N^T]^T$ consists of all concatenated jacobians that map either joint acceleration to end-effector motion, as in Equation \eqref{eq:jacobian} or joint acceleration to joint acceleration. The motion objective vector $\vect{p} = [\vect{p}_1^T\quad...\quad\vect{p}_N^T]^T$  consists of PD-controlled desired accelerations, coming for example from trajectory tracking of the swing leg or maintaining the upper-body orientation. %The last cost term $J_p$ is determined by the privileged joint accelerations $\ddqjntp$. Here is $\matr{J}_t$ the all-task jacobian consisting of both the momentum rate objective, as well as the motion objectives. The damped Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse  $\matr{J}_t^{\dagger} = \matr{J}_t^T(\matr{J}_t\matr{J}_t^T +\mu^2)^{-1}$ with $\mu>0$ is used in the null-space projector $(\matr{I} - \matr{J}_t^{\dagger}\matr{J}_t)$, which projects the priviliged acceleration objective in the null-space of the primary task jacobian $\matr{J}_t$. This can for example be used in singularity avoidance, where the priviliged accelerations are used to determine the configurarion of the robotic chain.  

An important note considering the research of focus is the generation of vertical \ac{CoM} motion of the robot. The desired linear momentum rate of change $\dotld$ consists, next to its horizontal component of Equation \eqref{eq:dotldxy}, of a vertical part:
\begin{equation}
\dotldz =m(k_p(z_r-z) - k_d\dot{z}), 
\label{eq:defaultheightcontrol}
\end{equation}
where $k_p, k_d$ are the PD-control gains and $z_r$ is the reference height coming from a reference trajectory. Decision variables for this trajectory are for example kinematic reachability and height changes in terrain, but maintaining the robot's balance is \textit{not} a part of those decision variables.


\paragraph{Inverse dynamics} translate desired joint accelerations and end-effector wrenches to desired joint torques. Desired joint torques $\bs{\tau}_d$ are calculated via a revursive Newton-Euler algorithm using the solution of whole-body \ac{QP}: $\ddqjntd$ and $\bs{\rho}$.
\begin{equation}
    \bs{\tau}_d = \matr{M}(\qjnt)\ddqjntd + \matr{C}(\qjnt,\dqjnt)\dqjnt + \matr{G}(\qjnt) + \matr{J}^T \vect{W}_{gr}.
\end{equation}
With the desired joint torques, the actuators of the robot are PD-controlled using a electrical current as input and joint torque and joint velocity measurements.

A high-level overview of the control framework is shown in \figref{fig:framework}. The `high level controller' block consists for example of the \ac{ICP} controller of Section \ref{sec:icpcontrol} and the height control law of Equation \eqref{eq:defaultheightcontrol}.

% CoM Height Variation
\section{Related Works}\label{sec:relatedworksheight}
In this short literature survey, the scope is not limited to only the use of vertical \ac{CoM} motion in balance control. Other goals of improvement, like improving dynamic planning for motions over rough-terrain or for more human-like motions, are discussed as well. The models and strategies used in these works can be insightful for the problem considered in this thesis.

Traditionally, vertical \ac{CoM} motion is generated through PD-control as in Equation \eqref{eq:defaultheightcontrol} \cite{kajita2003resolved, koolen2016design}: a dynamic reference plan exists, often based on the LIP model, and height variations are considered as disturbances on the model considered in the dynamical plan. Reasons to use height variations here include the guarantee of \textit{kinematic feasibility}: height variation allows the robot to step up platforms, and allows the robot to take larger steps. A noteworthy, more unique, example of height variation in non-predictive control is walking with straighter legs as in \cite{griffin2018straight}. The motivation in this work is to let the robot walk more \textit{human-like}, which could have more underlying benefits, such as kinematic reachability and metabolic energy consumption \cite{wang2012optimizing}.

\subsection{Dynamic Planning \& Walking Pattern Generation}
Because the constant height assumption of the \ac{LIP} is constraining the dynamics of the robotic system, efforts have been made to incorporate CoM height variation in the generation of a dynamic plan. Instead of using a LIP model, a more complicated model is used. \textit{Expected} height variations of the CoM can be incorporated in the dynamic planning problem, which improves the \textit{dynamic feasibility} of the plan. In theory, the reference dynamics are closer to the real dynamics of the robot. Deviations from the \ac{LIP} in the \ac{CoM} reference can be incorporated in the plan. These deviations can come for example from an un-even terrain, or a human-like walking pattern.

An example of incorporating height variations in terrain in the dynamic planning problem can be found in \cite{englsberger2013three}, which is an extension of \ac{ICP} planning as in Section \ref{subsec:icpplan}. Additional reference points, similar to ground reference points as in Section \ref{sec:grp}, are designed and used in the planning method. The drawback of this method is that still a linearized model is considered and the trajectories between footsteps for the dynamical plan are constrained to be straight lines. 

Another work improved this latter aspect by introducing the time-varying \ac{DCM} \cite{hopkins2014humanoid}. The natural frequency of the \ac{LIP} was made time-varying, such that the \ac{DCM} became time-varying. However, a closed-form solution using this method was not available anymore and a dynamic plan was computed numerically.

The methods presented in \cite{brasseur2015robust} and \cite{kajita2017biped} also show the objectives of walking with straighter legs in the dynamic planning problem. The objective in the optimization in \cite{brasseur2015robust} is to let the robot walk with the straightest legs as possible at any time. In \cite{kajita2017biped}, a \ac{2D} walking pattern is generated for walking with straighter legs. The third dimension is added, under the assumption that the dynamics in the sagittal plane and the coronal plane can be decoupled.

\subsection{Balance Control}\label{subsec:heightbalance}
A very recent objective is the specific use of \ac{CoM} height variation in \textit{balance control}. Traditional balance control strategies are taking a step, movement of the \ac{CoP}, also known as `ankle strategies' and, to a lesser extent, changing the angular momentum about the \ac{CoM}, for example: `hip strategies'. Recently, efforts have been made to incorporate vertical \ac{CoM} motions as an additional strategy for balance control. This is the research of focus in this report.

In this section, the following three publications that consider height variations as control input for balance are discussed. The work proposed by: Koolen, Posa \& Tedrake in \cite{koolen2016balance},  Gao, Jia \& Fu in \cite{gao2017increase} and  Caron \& Mallein in \cite{caron2018balance}:

% 2D polynomial
\paragraph{Koolen et al.} propose a \ac{2D} \ac{MPC} law, based on the \ac{VHIP} orbital energy proposed in \cite{pratt2007derivation}. This energy reads as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:evhip}
    E_{VHIP}  = \frac{1}{2}\dot{x}^2\bar{f}^2(x)+gx^2f(x) - 3g\int_{x_f}^{x} f(\xi)\xi d\xi = \frac{1}{2}\dot{x}_f^2\bar{f}^2(x_f)+gx_f^2f(x_f),
\end{equation}
where $E_{VHIP}$ is the \ac{VHIP} orbital energy. The virtual constraint $z=f(x)$ is used to make a closed-form solution possible for the energy. Furthermore, $\bar{f}(x)=f(x)-f'(x)x$. Unlike its \ac{LIP} cousin, this \ac{2D} orbital energy allows for \ac{CoM} height variation. Note that filling in a constant value for the function, $f(x)=z_0$, rewrites to the \ac{LIP} orbital energy.

The function $f(x)$ is constrained to be a cubic polynomial by Koolen et al. in \cite{koolen2016balance}. Using this description, four constraints are presented, which are used in a matrix to solve for the polynomial constants. There is one constraint on the final height, one constraint on the initial height, one on the initial direction and one constraint on conservation of $E_{VHIP}$. The final position of the polynomial trajectory is above the \ac{CoP} and the final velocity is zero, such that the resulting polynomial trajectory is a \textit{capture trajectory}. 

Similar to the capture regions of \cite{pratt2006capture}, \textit{regions of attraction} for this controller are investigated: initial states in which this controller is still able to let the \ac{VHIP} converge to the unstable equilibrium. However, there are no kinematic constraints taken into account, such that the polynomial trajectories can become unrealistically high above the ground. Though, the analytic solution for the capture trajectory guarantees fast computation times, which allow for the use in \ac{MPC}.

\paragraph{Gao et al.} present different \ac{2D} multi-step strategies to use vertical motion in balance control in \cite{gao2017increase}. An example is the lowering of the \ac{CoM} height in the current step, to exert more force and raise the \ac{CoM} in the next step. In this way, the pendulum can stop closer to the current position than with a \ac{LIP} trajectory. Furthermore, the natural frequency of the \ac{LIP} is adjusted for the added vertical acceleration. To make the dynamical model closed-form solvable over time, a constant height is considered, as the deviations from the initial height are considered as relatively small.

% boundedness
\paragraph{Caron \& Mallein} propose a \ac{3D} \ac{MPC} law in \cite{caron2018balance}, based on a height varying version of the boundedness condition from \cite{lanari2014boundedness}. In \cite{lanari2014boundedness}, the boundedness condition is based on the \ac{LIP} and presents a similar expression as the \ac{ICP}, but takes a time-varying ground reference point trajectory into account.  By using a time varying natural frequency of the pendulum $\omega(t)$, Caron \& Mallein combine the boundedness condition with the time-varying \ac{DCM} of \cite{hopkins2014humanoid}. By the nonlinearity of the problem, it is initially hard to solve real-time. The problem function is reformulated and written as a function of an inverse of time, rather than as a function of time. Also, the capture trajectory is divided in $10$ segments, which are considered to have a piece-wise time-invariant natural frequency. The resulting problem is solved using a nonlinear solver.

This work is expanded in \cite{caron2018capturability}. The problem is extended from `0-step' capture problems to multi-step problems. The problem formulation is rewritten and sequential quadratic programming is used to allow for fast computation times, which makes the multi-step problem solvable real time.

\subsection{Discussion}
The related works show that the use of \ac{CoM} height variations in dynamic planning is a relatively longer existing research than the use of  vertical \ac{CoM} motion in balance control. However, the difference between dynamic planning and \ac{MPC} can be small. The most notable difference between the two is that with \ac{MPC} replanning is conducted every control tick, while with dynamic planning this happens fewer times. Replanning every control tick allows to adjust the dynamic plan for disturbances applied on the system. The similarity between the two is that, in the works mentioned, both use a \ac{VHIP} or an adjusted \ac{LIP} model for computing the predicted dynamics of the system.

When going from the \ac{LIP} to the \ac{VHIP}, the problem arises of losing the explicit solution to the dynamics. To avoid large computation times due to numerical integration, in the works related to balance control constraints are introduced to allow for faster solutions. More specifically, Koolen et al. constrain the \ac{2D} vertical position of the \ac{VHIP} to be a cubic polynomial function of its horizontal position. Gao et al. consider an adjusted constant natural frequency for the \ac{LIP} model to account for vertical acceleration. Caron et al. use piece-wise time-invariant natural frequencies to obtain fast solutions. Furthermore, the kinematic constraints of the robot, such as a maximum leg length, are approximated with a minimum and maximum \ac{CoM} height.

Also, the works present no application of the controllers in a control framework to control humanoid robots. Therefore, the question remains what the advantages are of the presented \ac{MPC} law compared to using a \ac{LIP}-based proportional controller for example. In Chapter \ref{chap:standing} and Chapter \ref{chap:walking} of this report, \ac{CoM} height variations in balance control are compared with constant height approaches on humanoid robots.

Comparable with the \ac{LIP}-based `capture regions' in \cite{pratt2006capture}, \cite{koolen2012capturability} and `stable regions' \cite{stephens2007humanoid},  Koolen et al. investigate `regions of attraction' for the unconstrained \ac{VHIP} orbital energy trajectories. Traditional `capture regions' consider inertia about the \ac{CoM} to control the \ac{CP}. The \ac{VHIP} `regions of attraction' use \ac{CoM} height variation as a control input. The `regions of attraction' show an interesting insight in capture regions of the \ac{VHIP} model. However, only a constraint of contact unilaterality is considered and no additional constraints are introduced to take kinematic and torque limits of the robot into account. Also, the trajectory cannot have any desired shape and is constrained by the polynomial function.

In the next chapter, capture regions are presented for the \ac{VHIP} model, by considering additional constraints. Like in the approach of Caron et al., constraints on the kinematics and dynamics of the system are approximated with a constraint on vertical position and acceleration.
