\chapter*{Abstract}%

In this survey relevant literature to humanoid robot locomotion planning and control is analyzed and discussed. First, a  study is done on the terminology and simplified models used in humanoid robotics. After this, a global exploration of the current most popular planning and control strategies is done and summarized. An entire chapter is dedicated to the current attempts to use height variation in control and planning of locomotion. It appears that there are some attempts in this, but not many, and that hardware results are not often shown. This explains the research of focus and the challenge to apply it on hardware: the effects of \ac{CoM} height variations in planning and control of humanoid robot locomotion.
