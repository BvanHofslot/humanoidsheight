\chapter*{Abstract}%

In this survey relevant literature to humanoid robot locomotion planning and control is analyzed and discussed. First, a  study is done on the terminology and simplified models used in humanoid robotics. After this, a global exploration of the current most popular planning and control strategies is done and summarized. An entire chapter is dedicated to the current attempts to use height variation in control and planning of locomotion. It appears that some attempts exist, but that hardware results are not often shown or shown to be succesful compared to existing linear approaches. This finding explains the research of focus and the challenge to apply it on hardware: exploring the effects of \ac{CoM} height variation in planning and control of humanoid robot locomotion.
